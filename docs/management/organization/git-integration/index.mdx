Self-hosted GitLab hosting is not supported for the test script repository. You can use GitHub and GitLab services to integrate with projects.

## Prerequisites

:::tip

You can check the repository example at https://github.com/dogu-team/dogu-routine-examples.

:::

1. Create a repository in a Git service.
2. Create a `dogu.config.json` file in the **root directory** with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "workingDirPaths": ["selenium/typescript/jest"] // optional
   }
   ```

- `workingDirPaths`: Executes the `dogu-actions/run-test` command at the specified path. This is used when locating the working directory in the [Routine GUI editor](/routine/routines/editor).

## Integration
