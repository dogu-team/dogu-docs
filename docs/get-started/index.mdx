Dogu is an integration testing platform that helps you test web, app, and game applications in a variety of environments.  
An integrated testing platform simplifies building and managing the infrastructure for testing, and helps you focus on the testing itself.

## Why use Dogu?

### Build and manage your test environment
Purchasing various mobile devices, building infrastructure for testing, and managing test environments is a very complex task. The cost of building and managing test environments is also very high.  
Dogu provides a cloud-based test environment without these tasks, so you can reduce the cost of building and managing your test environment.

### Test Automation
Building and maintaining infrastructure components such as Selenium, Appium, OpenSTF, Jenkins, and Grafana for test automation requires significant time and effort.  
Since Dogu provides these infrastructure components, you can reduce the time and effort required for test automation.
