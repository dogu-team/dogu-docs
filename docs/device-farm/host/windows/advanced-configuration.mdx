# Advanced Configuration


## Sleep Settings

When entering Windows sleep mode, Dogu-Agent may stop operating unintentionally. Refer to [Document](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-adjust-power-and-sleep-settings-in-windows-26f623b5-4fcc-4194-863d-b824e5ea7679) Please set it so that it does not enter power saving mode.

## Software update

If software updates are turned on, Dogu-Agent may stop operating unintentionally. Blocking Windows updates is not a good idea, but if you need to block them, you can use software such as [Wu10Man](https://github.com/WereDev/Wu10Man) to block updates.
